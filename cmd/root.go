	Long: `Checks all http and https urls and reports if they return a non 200 code.
Additionally, checks github repos encountered and will report if they are stale, i.e.
if the last acitivity is more than a year ago.

docs-link-checker dir ~/mongo/docs-ecosystem --outfile results.json
docs-link-checker file ~/mongo/docs-ecosystem/community-supported-drivers.txt

If -o (--out) is specified, will attemp to write to the specified file.

Supports directory search and checking with the dir sub-command.
Supports individual file checking with the file sub-command.

docs-link-checker requires a Github API key to avoid being rate limited when it
is checking for repository freshness. You can generate a new API key by visiting:
https://github.com/settings/tokens

The token only needs the repo permission group.

Store the token either in your environment, or in a YAML config file. By default,
the program will check $HOME/.docs-link-checker.yaml
